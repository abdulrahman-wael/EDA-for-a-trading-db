# EDA for a trading dataset

## What is this?
This is an exploratory data analysis project using only T-SQL for the public dataset: https://www.dofactory.com/sql/sample-database. It focuses on data validation, basic analysis, and answering business questions related to trading from the dataset.

## Why this project is awesome?
1. I tried to make it as thorough and complete as possibleâ€”you can find 70+ SELECT statements in the project! (that's great as a first EDA attempt, I think)
2. Almost all of the code is written by me, not LLMs (I've marked only three comments written by an LLM in the code).

## How can you run the project?
1. Download and use MSSQL 2022: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads. Make sure to use this version specifically.
2. Use VS Code (with an extension like Database Client JDBC) or SSMS to view the data.
3. Download the ZIP file from this repo (it contains all the DDLs and data needed), unzip it, and run both scripts inside.
4. Open the file "EDA for Trading DB" and enjoy!

I greatly appreciate feedback. Thank you!
